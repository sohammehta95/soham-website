## Overview

This paper surveys augmented reality (AR) technology and its three core approaches: augmenting the user (wearable devices like HMDs and data gloves), augmenting the physical object (embedded sensors, intelligent bricks), and augmenting the surrounding environment (projectors, cameras, scanners). It explores applications across medicine, entertainment, and military aviation.

The paper also presents a marker-based AR system architecture for Android that uses camera input, image processing, marker tracking, and rendering modules to overlay virtual content onto the real world — with a specific application of making speech visible to deaf people on an AR display.
